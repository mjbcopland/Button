# Arduino Button Library

An Arduino library for debouncing and reading momentary contact switches like tactile button switches.  "Long presses" of arbitrary length can be detected. Works well in state machine constructs.  Use the read() function to read each button in the main loop, which should execute as fast as possible.

## Installation

1. Download _Button.zip_
2. In the Arduino IDE, navigate to _Sketch → Include Library → Add .ZIP Library..._
3. Browse to where _Button.zip_ was downloaded and open it
4. The library should now be installed. To use the library, navigate to Sketch → Include Library → Button

## Usage
